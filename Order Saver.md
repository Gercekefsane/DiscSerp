We want to explain with examples.
This function works as below.

Let's say you have 1000 Active Accounts,
Your Order Quantity is 2000.
Since you have 1000 Accounts, you can only deliver 1000 orders. You have to send 1000 partials.

This system continues to send by connecting to DiscSerp Servers.
For example, if DiscSerp has priced you $10 for 1000 server members. DiscSerp Pays $10 in Background and continues to send 1000 Server members.
